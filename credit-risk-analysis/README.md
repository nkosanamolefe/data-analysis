**<h2 align="center">Client Background</h2>**

Nova Bank is a diversified financial institution providing a range of loan products—including personal, medical, education, and business loans—across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The bank's primary objective is to balance fair and accessible lending with robust risk management. In the current economic climate of late 2025, with rising interest rates, precise and dynamic risk assessment is more critical than ever to maintain a healthy and competitive lending portfolio.

Nova Bank's key challenge is to optimize its lending decisions. Overly permissive lending can lead to financial losses from defaults, while overly strict criteria can result in missed opportunities and alienated potential customers. This analysis aims to provide data-driven insights to help Nova Bank refine its lending policies for both improved safety and fairness.

**<h2 align="center">Executive Summary</h2>**

This report presents an analysis of Nova Bank's loan portfolio to identify key drivers of credit risk and provide actionable recommendations for optimizing lending strategies. The analysis focuses on identifying borrower segments with a higher likelihood of default, the most significant factors in predicting loan outcomes, and the interplay between loan terms and risk.

**Key Findings:**
- Borrowers seeking debt consolidation loans exhibit a higher default rate compared to those seeking education or personal loans.
- The debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is a primary indicator of repayment capability, with a clear threshold beyond which default risk increases significantly.
- While employment type shows some correlation with default rates, home ownership status does not appear to be a significant differentiating factor in the observed data.
- Geographic analysis indicates a notable variance in default rates between the USA and the UK, suggesting that macroeconomic factors or regional lending practices may be at play.

**<h2 align="center">Dataset</h2>**

This analysis is based on a pilot dataset provided by Nova Bank, containing 30 individual loan records, each described by over 30 distinct fields. These fields encompass a comprehensive range of information, including borrower demographics, employment status, loan characteristics (purpose, amount, grade), and key financial health indicators such as debt-to-income ratios and credit history.
