**<h2 align="center">Client Background</h2>**

Nova Bank is a diversified financial institution providing a range of loan products—including personal, medical, education, and business loans across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The bank's primary objective is to balance fair and accessible lending with robust risk management. In the current economic climate of late 2025, with rising interest rates, precise and dynamic risk assessment is more critical than ever to maintain a healthy and competitive lending portfolio.

Nova Bank's key challenge is to optimize its lending decisions. Overly permissive lending can lead to financial losses from defaults, while overly strict criteria can result in missed opportunities and alienated potential customers. This analysis aims to provide data-driven insights to help Nova Bank refine its lending policies for both improved safety and fairness.

**<h2 align="center">Executive Summary</h2>**

This analysis of Nova Bank's $312.43 million loan portfolio, comprising 33,000 loans, reveals a significant credit risk exposure, with an overall **default rate of 21.82%** by loan count and a **financial loss rate of 24.69%**, amounting to over **$77 million in defaulted loan value**. Our findings indicate that credit risk is not evenly distributed across the portfolio; rather, it is highly concentrated and predictable based on specific loan and borrower characteristics.

**Key Findings:**

1.  **Credit Grade is the Primary Indicator of Risk:** The bank's internal credit grading system is a powerful predictor of loan performance. While Grade A loans have a manageable default rate, risk escalates dramatically with lower grades. **Grade D represents a critical tipping point**, where the number of defaults (2.1K) exceeds performing loans (1.49K), indicating an extremely high probability of loss for this segment and below.

2.  **Loan Purpose Influences Default Rates:** Borrowers seeking loans for **Debt Consolidation and Medical expenses exhibit the highest propensity to default**. In contrast, loans for Education and Personal use carry a comparatively lower risk, suggesting that the underlying reason for borrowing is a key factor in repayment behavior.

3.  **Geographic Location is Not a Major Differentiator:** Despite operating across multiple cities in the USA, UK, and Canada, the analysis shows that default risk is remarkably consistent, with rates clustering tightly between **20% and 25% across all major cities**. This suggests that risk is driven more by borrower profiles and loan terms than by regional economic factors.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Tighten Underwriting for High-Risk Grades:** Immediately review and strengthen lending criteria for loans graded D and lower. Consider ceasing origination in these segments or implementing significantly higher interest rates and lower loan-to-value ratios to compensate for the inherent risk.
*   **Price Risk According to Loan Purpose:** Adjust risk models and pricing to account for the higher default rates associated with Debt Consolidation and Medical loans.
*   **Focus on Borrower-Centric Risk Factors:** Since geography is not a strong risk driver, resources should be focused on refining the assessment of individual borrower financial health, such as debt-to-income ratios and credit history, which are likely stronger predictors.
